M&amp;E services under this BPA include designing and conducting evaluations of OTA initiatives, supporting M&amp;E process improvements and facilitating program learning.</p><p style="-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:inherit;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:proxima-nova, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:20px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:1.6;margin-top:0px;orphans:2;text-align:left;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;">This three-year BPA builds on Bixal’s M&amp;E capabilities, which were significantly augmented in January 2021, when we acquired Clear Outcomes. As Bixal furthers our data science and analytics practice area, we also continue to enhance our M&amp;E services by integrating them with our transformational technology and data-driven capabilities.</p>'
